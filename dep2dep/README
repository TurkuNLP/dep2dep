****************************************************************

To test the system, first 'make' (see the INSTALL file for
dependencies) and then run './testlp2lp' - you should get an
output that looks something like this:

0 2 nmod>
1 2 nmod>
2 3 nsubj>
3 10 <ccomp
4 10 complm>
5 6 <prep
5 10 nsubjpass>
6 8 <pobj
7 8 det>
9 10 auxpass>
...
