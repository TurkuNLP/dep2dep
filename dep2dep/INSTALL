In order to successfully compile the lp2lp transformation library,
you need to have the following environment:

1) Installation of SWI prolog with the development tools
   - header files in (by default) /usr/lib/swi-prolog/include (you can edit the Makefile if the headers are elsewhere)
   - libraries (at least):
        - libpl (prolog)
        - libgmp (numerical library for prolog)
   - the plld program (comes with SWI prolog)

2) Installation of PCRE with the development tools
   - header files (pcre.h)
   - libraries
        - libpcre


3) Recent Python (tested with 2.4 and 2.5)

Then just type 'make'.

The setup is tested on Ubuntu Linux 7.04 as well as Gentoo linux
with recent SWI prolog installed and PCRE install from the
distro's package manager.
